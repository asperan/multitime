# Disclaimer

This project has been created to reserve the name on crates.io, as I'm planning to start working on this some time soon (maybe before summer 2024).

If you want to use this name, you can request it by opening an issue on [my repository for discussions and requests](https://github.com/asperan/discussions-and-requests).

**IMPORTANT**: opening the issue does not imply that I'll surely give up on the project name, it is just a "formal" and public request.

While this disclaimer is present, the probability that the published project just contains an hello world file is almost 100%.
